# Random-Forest-Algorithm

Random Forest is a version of Ensemble Learning.Ensemble learning in simple terms is when you take an algorithm or multiple algorithms and apply it multiple times to make it more powerful than the original version.

- In this project, we will build a model to predict what salary that should be offered to an employee based on Position and Level.

## Dataset

- First let’s look at the dataset. It is Salaries.csv.
- It has 3 columns — “Position”, “Level” and “Salary” and describes the approximate salary range for an employee based on what level he falls under.
